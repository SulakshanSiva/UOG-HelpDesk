# UOG-HelpDesk

During the summer of 2025, I was granted the opportunity to work on the development team for the Helpdesk application, created by [Stefan C. Kremer](https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing/people/stefan-kremer). I was the sole developer who worked on improving the Helpdesk codebase, with a goal of improving the developer experience. As this application is used by students and teaching staff at the University of Guelph, the codebase will not be available to the public. This README.MD file will showcase the functionalities of this web-based application.
