# UOG-HelpDesk

During the summer of 2025, I was granted the opportunity to work on the development team for the Helpdesk application, created by [Stefan C. Kremer](https://www.uoguelph.ca/computing/people/stefan-kremer). I was the sole developer who worked on improving the Helpdesk codebase, with a goal of improving the developer experience. As this application is used by students and teaching staff at the University of Guelph, the codebase will not be available to the public. This README.MD file will showcase the functionalities of this web-based application. 

## What is Helpdesk

Helpdesk is an application designed to enable students to interact with professors and teaching staff for their respective courses. Using their University of Guelph credentials, students can sign into Helpdesk to gain access to their enrolled courses. Helpdesk grants students the ability to ask questions via ticket submissions, sign up for demo appointments, and request regrades. Professors and teaching staff can use Helpdesk to answer student inquiries, view class lists, and more. This web application seeks to improve the student experience by allowing for quick access to resources and tools to aid their educational needs.
